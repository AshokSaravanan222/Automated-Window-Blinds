# Automated-Window-Blinds (WIP)

I attempted to automate the window blinds in my room using Arduino. I hoped that the motor would turn, pulling down the blinds that are connected. However, the motor that I used was not built for the task.

# Testing

The 5V DC motor was very weak and could not pull down the blinds. If I want this to work in the future, I will need to upgrade from low voltage Arduino parts.
